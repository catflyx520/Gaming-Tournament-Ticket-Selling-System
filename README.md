I was mainly in charged of design the subsystem include the domain class diagram, database schema, event diagram, use cases, and activity diagram. 

In the beginning, we were trying to create too many subsystems but it was harder than we expected, Thus a lot of works and diagrams were lay to waste. 
It is hard to communicate and work as a group during the quarantine time (First project done right after COVID). 
It took a while for us to find out how to connect the database with the website.
